        <article><p>"You Belong with Me"</p> is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released to US radio on April 20, 2009, as the third single from her second studio album, Fearless (2008). Inspired by a phone call between a member of her touring band and his girlfriend that she overheard, Swift wrote the song with Liz Rose to depict a narrator's unrequited love for a boy unappreciated by his girlfriend. Swift and Nathan Chapman produced "You Belong with Me", which features a banjo-led production and incorporates fiddle, mandolin, and rock-influenced bass and electric guitars. Although the single was promoted to country radio by Big Machine Records, critics deemed it a pop song that stylistically aligns with 1980s subgenres such as pop rock and power pop.

            When "You Belong with Me" was first released, critics praised the song's radio-friendly production and emotional engagement that appealed to a broad audience, although some deemed Swift's songwriting formulaic. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, "You Belong with Me" was nominated in three categories, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. The single reached the top ten on charts and received sales certifications in Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first country song to reach number one on both Hot Country Songs and the all-genre Radio Songs chart. The single was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
            
            Roman White directed the song's music video, which stars Swift as both the antagonist, an unsympathetic, popular cheerleader; and the protagonist, a sympathetic girl next door who yearns for the antagonist's boyfriend; some critics took issue with the video's narrative as antifeminist. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where "You Belong with Me" won Best Female Video, rapper Kanye West interrupted Swift's acceptance speech, which caused a controversy widely covered by the media. Following the 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as "You Belong with Me (Taylor's Version)" for her re-recorded album Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021). "You Belong with Me" was included on the set lists of all five of her headlining tours.
        <p>"Heart Attack"</p> <p>is a song recorded by American singer Demi Lovato. The song was released on February 25, 2013, as the lead single from her fourth studio album Demi (2013). It was produced by Mitch Allan, and Jason Evigan of "The Suspex", who co-wrote the song along with Lovato, Sean Douglas, Nikki Williams, and Aaron Phillips. "Heart Attack" is an electropop song that employs cardiac motifs to represent the fear of falling in love. It received acclaim from music critics, many of whom complimented its lyrics and Lovato's vocals.

            The song sold 215,000 copies in the US in its first week, her best sales week for a song download, and peaked at number ten on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lovato's second solo top-ten single on the chart. It was later certified 5x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Heart Attack" also performed well internationally, reaching the top 10 in Canada, Ireland, Lebanon, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.
            
            An accompanying music video for "Heart Attack" was directed by Chris Applebaum and was premiered through Vevo on April 9, 2013. Lovato has performed the track on several television programs and has also included the song on the setlists for The Neon Lights Tour, Demi World Tour, Future Now Tour, Tell Me You Love Me World Tour, and Holy Fvck Tour. A re-recorded rock version was released on March 24, 2023, and included on her first remix album titled Revamped.</p>

                        </article><p>Shelter in Place</p> is a pandemic horror movie with a lot of promise. A couple is stranded at the Roosevelt Hotel during the quarantine. As more time passes, tensions escalate between the pair and the remaining staff. It is soon revealed cabin fever is not the biggest concern. In any movie dealing with COVID, there are going to be certain emotions that have to be touched on. Paranoia, tension, and frustration have to be high. Plus, since Shelter in Place is a horror movie, there has to be an element of fear. While the former is there, the film is unable to deliver the scares, ironically.

                        Sara Burke (Tatjana Marjanovic) and her husband John (Brendan Hines) have been trapped in the infamous Roosevelt for an undisclosed amount of time. Johns seems content not to work while Sara has been making money as an influencer. As Shelter in Place progresses, it becomes clear the two are not quite happy with the arrangement. It starts with little comments but becomes more obvious.
